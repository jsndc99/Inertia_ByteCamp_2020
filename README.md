# Description

The project aims to quantify the attention paid by a user to online lectures and provide analysis of the same attention data. It uses the user's webcam to analyse the user's emotions, gaze and position of the hands to determine the attention. 

Our main aim while developing the project was to ensure **user privacy was not compromised.** Some steps we have taken to guarantee the same are:
* Webcam video feed doesn't leave the user's device. User data is kept secure. The webcam video feed isn't saved on the device or on any server. Only the attention metrics (no personal data) is sent to the server.
* The sign up and login processes do not use the user's face. Instead only the face features are used, which ensures privacy is protected.
* The database doesn't store any personal information of the users.
